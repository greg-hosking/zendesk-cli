# Zendesk Coding Challenge

Installation and Usage Instructions
--------------------------
[1] Make sure you have downloaded Python 3 on your computer... if you do not have Python 3 on your computer, follow the instructions at this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/. \
[2] Download the cli.py and tests.py files. \
[3] Open the folder where you downloaded the file(s) in a command prompt. \
[4] To run either of the files, use the following command: python {filename.py} \
[5] Once you run either file, you will be prompted for three pieces of information: the subdomain you are trying to access, the email associated with this subdomain, and an access token. These must be entered in order for either program to run! \
(The subdomain is {subdomain}.zendesk.com, the email is the one that you used to create or access that subdomain, and you can create a new access token if you do not have one using the Zendesk agent under Admin > API and be sure to enable token access.)
