# Zendesk Coding Challenge

As part of the application process for a Software Engineering Intern position at Zendesk, I was required to use the Zendesk Ticket API to build a CLI that allows the user to easily view and look up tickets.

# Installation and Usage

1. Download and install Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download the cli.py and/or tests.py files.
3. Open the folder where you downloaded the file(s) in a command prompt.
4. Run either of the files using the following command: python {filename.py} 
5. Enter the following required input data: the subdomain to access, the email associated with this subdomain, and an access token.
